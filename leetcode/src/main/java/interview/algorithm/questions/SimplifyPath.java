/**
 * Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
 * For example,
 * path = "/home/", => "/home"
 * path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
 * click to show corner cases.
 * Corner Cases:
 * Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
 * In this case, you should return "/".
 * Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together,
 * such as "/home//foo/".
 * In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
